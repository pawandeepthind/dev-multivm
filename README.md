# What

Project is to setup multi-vm development environment (replicate production locally) with pre-required software installed on the machines. This setup uses
  * vagrant
  * virtual box as the provider
  * Ansible to orchestrate installation of software
  
  Topology for multiple virtual machine consist of:

  * One management server where ansible is installed when machine is provisioned. (Note: This machine is the last machine, and only one in the group in config.yml and is of type master)
  * Other machines in the topology is defined using configuration 

User can bring up the machine with one command ``` vagrant up ```.

This brings up multi-vm development environments with 
  * Connected machines.
  * Public/Private keys setup for password less access
  * Ansible installed on master machine, that will trigger setup.yml
  * setup.yml can be used to setup what roles to apply on which machine or group of machine.

# How

## 1. Install Pre-requisite:

It is good to read about Vagrant and Ansible.

## Here are some of the pre-requisite (Note: It is tested on Mac OS X for now)

  * vagrant (tested with vagrant 1.9.7)
  * Virtual Box (tested with VirtualBox 5.1.26r117224)
  * Software is installed in the machines using [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) that is installed on mgmt_server
  * Install plugins (vbguest and hostmanager)
    
  ```
  $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
  $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
  ```

## 2. config.yml configurations

```yml
---
groups: # root for multi-vm configuration
  - group_name: oracle_group # group name where we can define one or more servers
    servers: #array of servers that needs to be configured in this group
      - name: oracle # name of the server
        type: slave # type of the server (slave or masster), note: there needs to be one machine of type master and others should be slave. And master machine should be in the end and that gorup should have only one machine
        box: centos/7 # which vagrant box to use to setup base machine
        memory: 512 # memory that should be given to the machine
        ip: 10.0.20.20 # ip address that should be given to the machine
        synced_folders: # list of folders to setup the sync
          - { guest: "./server", host: "/home/vagrant/server" }
        forwarded_ports: # list of ports to be forwarded from the guest to host
          - { guest: 1521, host: 1521 }
  - group_name: activemq_group
    servers:
      - name: activemq
        type: slave
        box: centos/7
        memory: 512
        ip: 10.0.20.30
        synced_folders: 
          - { guest: "./server", host: "/home/vagrant/server" }
        forwarded_ports:
          - { guest: 61616, host: 8616 }
          - { guest: 8161, host: 8161 }
  - group_name: management_server 
    servers:
      - name: mgmt
        type: master
        box: centos/7
        memory: 256
        ip: 10.0.20.10
        synced_folders: 
          - { guest: "./server", host: "/home/vagrant/server" }
        forwarded_ports:
```

# 3. Install required roles 

Install server/roles folder and update setup.yml to setup the roles that should be applied on the groups.
